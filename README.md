**There are several times when using Google Trends is a smart tactic. Read on for six ideal situations to use this tool.** 


## When You Run Out of Topics
Google Trends can be a great tool for coming up with a list of topics to write about in your content. If you have run out of ideas, consider using Google Trends to find more. When you type a search term into Google Trends, it will show you the relative popularity of a topic over the last 12 months by default. You can change the time range to custom parameters to narrow or widen the scope of the data.

Use this information to determine if a topic you are researching is going to be valuable to readers. Looking at user demand will show you if it is an optimal time to write about a particular topic.


## When Planning Content
When you are planning your content, using Google Trends can be helpful. Searching the topics you want to write about on Google Trends will allow you to see if the search data shows a rise or fall in popularity. Then, you can create a content calendar with different topics that are trending this month and repeat the process each month.

A great feature that Google Trends has is the map of interest by subregion. You can use this to see local versus national popularity. Google Trends will tell you if a certain topic is trending in your home state and if the local value is high.


## When Current Events Affect Your Niche
A neat feature to utilize on Google Trends is the top trending searches page. Looking through this list shows you the most popular topics being searched at this moment. These often are current events that you can capitalize on and plan posts around for the future.

## When You Need Keyword Ideas
Another reason to use Google Trends is that it offers an easy way to find keywords to target in your content. Let’s say you are a company that sells wholesale supplies to small businesses. 

If you are looking to find what content is currently popular on Google, then you can use Google Trends to find that information and use it to your advantage. 

## When Picking a Niche
Google Trends can be valuable when it comes to picking your niche because it is a great resource for checking search terms or keywords in real-time. Since Google Trends updates in real-time, it can show data that other tools miss.

When picking a niche, you don’t want to pick something that is only temporarily trending. But by changing the date range to the past five years instead of the past 12 months, you can see the relative popularity over an extended period of time.

If a niche has steady popularity over the last five years, it will likely be a better choice than something that has only recently spiked in popularity.
